code to generate figure 2
note that the ODE solver might throw some warnings, this is expected due to 
the unbounded cell growth in the naive model.

to generate the output to plot figure 2C, first run the script "run_fig2C.py"
Alternatively, you can also plot the figure directly by using the provided output file output_fig2C.csv.
Note that in this case, the resolution of the step size is decreased.
